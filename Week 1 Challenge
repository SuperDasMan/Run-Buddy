**WEEK 1 CHALLENGE**

Description: The task assigned was to refactor an existing site. Starting with the given Starter Code, I cleaned up the coding to make it fit accessibility and semantics parameters as outlined.

Changes made to HTML coding includes adding (meta) tags for search engine optimization, cleaning up semantics by changing many broad (div) tags to more specific tags, and adding (alts) to (img) tags.

Changes made to .css coding includes combining similar classes that shared attributes, or shifting desired attributes to a parent class: i.e. h2, h3, and benefits.
